function y=fhmvmultiply_1D(h,x)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Fast Hankel matrix vector mulitplication.
%
%Inputs
% h: column vector that generates the Hankel matrix H.
% x: column vector to be left multiplied by H.
%
%Output
% y: H*x.  
%
%Example
% h=rand(128,1);x=rand(65,1);y=fhmvmultiply_1D(h,x), where y is the 
% multiplication of the Hankel matrix formed by h of size 64*65 with the 
% vector x.
